The goal for POWER GRID was to create a game centered around the concept of sustainabiity in electricty generation.
Currently 80% of electricity is generated using nonrenewable sources.

The player is tasked with building out a power grid to sustain 10 homes. They can choose between power plants that are cheaper, but produce smog
or powerplants that are more expensive, but produce clean energy. Should the player create too much smog though, the game is lost.
This encourages the player to experiment with methods different techniques of building out the power grid to achieve the best rating.
The player will receive a raing based on their smog output and time spent playing. Too much smog leads to a lower output, but also
taking too long to reach the goal will also lower the rating. The player must act fast and efficiently to solve the puzzle.
